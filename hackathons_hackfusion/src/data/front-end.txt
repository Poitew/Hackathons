Becoming a front end developer is very easy, it is in fact one of the most popular starting point of every new developer as the path is fairly easy and straightforward.
That is beacuse for the most part there is not really any choice on what language to learn; HTML for the structure, CSS for the style and JavaScript for the interactivity (There also is TypeScript but it is a superset of JavaScript and at the end of the day it still translates to JavaScript).
The only part where there is a bit of a choice is about what JavaScript framework to learn (a framework is a set of functionality to help developers build software), there are quite a few options but the main one are:
React.JS, Vue.JS, Angular and Svelte; the latter is however still new and rarely used in real workspace.

This website will teach you HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Vue.JS.
